# Network Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on analyzing network intrusion detection data using machine learning techniques. The dataset used comes from the KDD Cup 1999 competition, which contains network traffic data labeled as normal or attack instances. The primary objective of this project is to preprocess the dataset, apply various classification models, and evaluate their performance in detecting intrusions.
The KDD Cup 1999 dataset consists of network traffic instances labeled as either normal or attack (e.g., denial-of-service (DoS), unauthorized access, remote-to-local attacks). The challenge lies in accurately classifying these instances using machine learning models. Key aspects of the problem include:
•	Handling high-dimensional data with a mix of numerical and categorical attributes.
•	Identifying important features that contribute to intrusion detection.
•	Comparing the effectiveness of multiple machine learning models in classifying network traffic patterns.
•  Model Training & Evaluation:
•	Implement and train multiple classification models to detect network intrusions:<br/>
<br/>
o	Random Forest Classifier
o	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
o	Logistic Regression
o	Decision Tree Classifier
o	Naive Bayes Classifier
•	Assess model performance using:
o	Cross-validation scores
o	Accuracy metrics
o	Confusion matrices
o	Classification reports
•  Performance Comparison & Insights:
•	Compare the models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
•	Determine which algorithm is most effective for intrusion detection and discuss potential improvements.
